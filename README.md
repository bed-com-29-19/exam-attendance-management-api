## Project Overview

Title: Attendance Management System
Objective: To develop a mobile-based examination attendance system that integrates with Google Sheets for remote data persistence.

## Problem Statement

The traditional manual attendance system is time-consuming, prone to human error, and inefficient. This project aims to address these challenges by introducing a mobile-based attendance system that is fast, accurate, and seamlessly integrated with Google Sheets for data storage and retrieval.

## Target Users

- Academic instructors responsible for marking student attendance during examinations

## System Architecture

The Attendance Management System will consist of three main components:
1. **Mobile Application**: The primary interface for instructors to mark student attendance during examinations.
2. **Google Sheets Database**: Central repository for storing attendance data.
3. **Synchronization Mechanism**: Ensures periodic upload of attendance data from the mobile application to Google Sheets.

## Conclusion

The Attendance Management System aims to streamline the process of marking student attendance during examinations, reducing time, human error, and redundant work. By integrating with Google Sheets, the system ensures secure and accessible storage of attendance data for easy retrieval and analysis. The mobile application provides a user-friendly interface for instructors to mark attendance and view attendance records.
